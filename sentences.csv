Utterance
My family is going to a soccer game tomorrow.
The NC Courage are playing Racing Louisville.
The Courage are an NWSL team.
They are one point behind Racing Louisville for the last playoff spot.
There are only four games left in the regular season.
This is an important game.
The Courage have won two of their last three games.
They lost their most recent game.
The game will be held in Raleigh.
It is Play 4 Kay Night.
Kay is Kay Yow who was a basketball coach for NCSU.
Kay died of breast cancer in 2009.
Play for Kay Night is about raising awareness for breast cancer.
This is more important than soccer.
My wife is celebrating 5 years of survival.
She is now officially cancer free.
My sign will say I fight for Marcia.
We will also have a meal at her favorite restaurant.
Our daughter will be with us.
Her sign will say I fight for Mom.
